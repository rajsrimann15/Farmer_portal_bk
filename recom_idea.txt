1) I cannot completely re design my architecture to use kafka.
2) I have planned to build notification system (later) and recommendation system
2) say where we can use kafka in it.


Before that let me say how my project is designed.


API Gateway --> 1) user_service - own Db
		2)tranport_sevice - own Db
		3)prciing_service - own Db

Each service is independent now, every request happen from api gateway, No inter-communication b/w the services.
Lets build the inter communication to build a recommendation service.


Recommendation Sytem ( to farmer only)
1) from user_service - update how many new farmer register this portal in last week.
2) from ecom_service - update how many  farmer  posted produc in this ecom service in last week.
3) from pricing_service - (we ll decide later)


use a simple ML model and easy and clean way.
